# feature-extraction
Messing around with machine learning, pattern extraction, and image processing in java.

## the aim
Create or represent feature extraction techniques provided from the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_extraction).

## how to break this down
There will be three things done in order to achieve a successful representation of each and every feature extraction technique.

1. Understanding the meaning and process behind the technique
  * This will start out with a break down of the wikipedia page
    * Creating a readme file for every technique
    * Addressing the purpose of the technique
    * Determining the best course of action to implement the technique
2. Plan out project
  * Create either UML or spreadsheet like files to represent how the project will be formed
  * Create pseudocode in order to form a general outline for the code
3. Create the project

## current work

### low-level
  * [edge detection](https://github.com/ajchili/feature-extraction/tree/master/edge%20detection)
  * corner detection
  * blob detection
  * ridge detection
  * scale-invariant feature transform
  
### curvature
  * edge direction
  * changing intensity
  * autocorrelation
  
### shape based
 * thresholding
 * blob extraction
 * template matching
 * hough transform
   * lines
   * circles/ellipses
   * arbitrary shapes
